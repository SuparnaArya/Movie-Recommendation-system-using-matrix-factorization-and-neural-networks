# Movie-Recommendation-system-using-matrix-factorization-and-neural-networks

This project has been made as a part of Data Science project course.
We want to deal with the movie recommendation system problem using matrix factorization and weâ€™re taking 3 approaches to solve the problem:
1. Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ):
   - Decomposes a matrix into several component matrices
3. Non-negative matrix factorization (NNF):
   - Uses non-negative values for the inputs
   - Performs better for sparse  matrices
5. Matrix Factorization using Neural Networks:
   - Uses deep learning for  the model
   - To capture  non-linearity of the data
